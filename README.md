# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

This app was developed for the Rutgers coding bootcamp. It is a simple weather app that uses OpenWeatherAPI's Current Weather and 5-day 3-hour api. This was a really fun project that involved navigating promissed arrays and creating alot of functions to check and filter data. A problem i ran into was getting the city history to render each time a new city was searched. I was able to fix this issue by seeing if the city already existed in the history list.

## Usage

To use the Weather App, you can enter a city and click search. To the right of the search bar you will see the current weather and under that the weather for the next five days. You'll notice that once you search a new city it will appear in the history below. You can click on these buttons and the weather will display. To inspect each element, you can open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you can navigate to the local storage in the applications tab to see an object array of what you searched.
